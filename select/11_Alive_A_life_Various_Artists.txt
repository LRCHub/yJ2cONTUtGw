Oh picture it a little girl just a beautiful eight year old
Trying to live through this life in a crazy world
Years past and one bad move
She finds herself as a teen and her life in ruins
What could have happened if we stopped and took the time
Showed that girl she had meaning and a purpose to life
Maybe avoid that downward slide
Would you tell her the truth?
Or let her live in a lie?

It all just seems to change
When you see it as a life to save

So would you save a life, save a life?
If it was do or die
Would you save a soul, save a soul?
Even if its not your own?
If you're the hands and the arms that reach
Would you save a life from drowning?

Would you cry out if it was the moment of truth?
Would you reach out if there was something to lose?
Life or death would you take a deep breath
And dive in a save a life that needs to be rescued?
We'd prevent it if we just explained
About the tides and the undertows and deadly waves
We could save a life before it needs to be saved
Why wait for tomorrow we can start today

It all just seems to change
When you see it as a life to save

So would you save a life, save a life?
If it was do or die
Would you save a soul, save a soul?
Even if it's not your own
If you're the hands and the arms that reach
Would you save a life from drowning?

(Would you take a role, would you think about it?)
If she started drifting further,
Would you take a minute,
Would you think about it?
If the waves came crashing forward,
Would you take a minute,
Would you think about it?

It all just seems to change
When you see it as a life to save

So would you save a life, save a life?
If it was do or die
Would you save a soul, save a soul?
Even if it's not your own
If you're the hands and the arms that reach
Would you save a life from drowning?

So would you save a life, save a life?
(Oh picture it a little girl just a beautiful eight year old, Trying to live through this life in a crazy world)
Would you save a soul, save a soul?
(Years past and one bad move, She finds herself as a teen and her life in ruins)
If you're the hands and the arms that reach
Would you save a life from drowning?

(If she started drifting further, If the waves came crashing forward)
